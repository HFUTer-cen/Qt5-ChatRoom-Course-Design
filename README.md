## Visual Chatroom Based on TCP/IP protocol 
 _This is a very simple demo implemented by Qt5.9, supporting multiple clients 
 chatting with each other simultaneously within a common LAN ._

## Something need to be mentioned 
 - This program does use neither `winsock` nor `linux socket`. Instead, it was implemented by `QTcpServer` and `QTcpSocket`.
