## Visual Chatroom Based on TCP/IP protocol 
 _This is a very simple demo implemented by Qt5.9, supporting multiple clients chatting with each other simultaneously._

## Something need to be mentioned 
 - This program does use neither `winsock` nor `linux socket`. Instead, it was implemented by `QTcpServer` and `QTcpSocket`.
 - You can copy the source code of GUI to save your time if you need to make a similar course design like this.
